# Langchain_Experiments
 
This repo focusses on the exploration of langchain and its capabilities
through various types of models like LLM's, chat models, embedding models.

In each directory i experimented on different types of models, i am excited on 
the embedding models like converting the documents, query to embeddings and done a 
small mini project on semantic search.

Upto now, i just generated the embeddings at run time, but in future, i will store these embeddings 
and optimise futher
